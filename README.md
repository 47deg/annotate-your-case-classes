# Annotate your Case Classes

Chances are, you occasionally need some way to apply a specific behavior to your classes—even more often if you’re managing your domain model.

Scala macros could be the perfect solution and in this repo we are showing a specific use case related with the annotations in your code. This is the companion for the Scala Macros article published in this [Blog Post](http://www.47deg.com/blog/scala-macros-annotate-your-case-classes).

## Test the Macro

```bash
 ./activator ";project examples;test"
 ```
